# Project Overview

This project was built using **Unity 6000.2.14f1**.  
It provides a complete workflow for handling web requests, parsing incoming data, controlling UI elements, and managing character animations based on data received from WebRequests.

## Unity Version

This project was created and tested with:

**Unity 6000.2.14f1**

For best compatibility, use the same or a newer 6000.x version.

---

## Web Request Handling — `NetworkHandler`

<img width="816" height="141" alt="Zrzut ekranu 2025-12-04 004651" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0d08021-b8ea-4a5e-a2dc-8796b648ad66" />

All communication with the server is managed through the **NetworkHandler** script.  
It exposes four events that allow you to hook into different stages of the WebRequest lifecycle:

```csharp
public event Action OnResponseWaiting;
public event Action<string> OnResponseReceivedSuccess;
public event Action<string> OnResponseReceivedFailure;
public event Action OnResponseTimeout;
```

### Features

- **Support for sending requests to a local Ollama instance**, enabling local AI responses.  
- **The timeout duration can be configured directly from the Unity Inspector**, allowing easy adjustments without modifying code.  

### Event Descriptions

- **OnResponseWaiting**  
  Triggered while waiting for a response.

- **OnResponseReceivedSuccess(string)**  
  Triggered when a response is received successfully.  
  Returns the WebRequest result as a **string**.

- **OnResponseReceivedFailure(string)**  
  Triggered when a response fails.  
  Returns the error message as a **string**.

- **OnResponseTimeout**  
  Triggered if the response exceeds the expected timeout duration.

---

## Data Parsing — `DataParser`

Incoming WebRequest data can be parsed into readable structures.  
**Supported data types:**  

- `ResponseData`  
- `CharacterData`  
- `Status` (string)  
- `OllamaResponseData` — represents a single chunk of data returned by Ollama. Multiple chunks can be combined to obtain the complete response as a **string**.

---

## User Interface — `ConversationUI` and `CharacterUI`

### `ConversationUI`

Responsible for the chat-related UI:
- Input Field for entering messages  
- Text Field showing the full message history  
- Send Button  
- Ability to send messages via keyboard shortcut  
- Easily extendable to support additional input devices, **including new inputs from other external devices**  
- **Device input can be configured to send messages either to Ollama or to the local host bot**, allowing flexible routing of user input.

### `CharacterUI`

Currently manages the character satisfaction bar:
- Its color reflects the current satisfaction value

---

## Character Animation — `CharacterAnimatorController`

The **CharacterAnimatorController** updates character animations based on the status received from the WebRequest.

Available animations are defined in a **ScriptableObject** called `CharacterStatusData`.

- If a received status is **not** listed in the ScriptableObject, a **default status** defined there will be used.

## Data Structures

This project uses several data structures to manage incoming and outgoing data for WebRequests, characters, and animations.

---

### WebRequest Data

These structures are used for sending requests and parsing responses from WebRequests and Ollama.

#### `ResponseData`
- **Purpose:** Base structure obtained from a WebRequest.
- **Fields:**
  - `character` (**CharacterData**) — contains character-related information.

#### `CharacterData`
- **Purpose:** Holds information about a character.
- **Fields:**
  - `name` (**string**) — character's name.
  - `satisfaction` (**int**) — character's satisfaction level.
  - `mood` (**int**) — character's current mood.

#### `OllamaRequestData`
- **Purpose:** Represents the data sent along with a prompt to Ollama.
- **Fields:**
  - `model` (**string**) — the Ollama model to use.
  - `prompt` (**string**) — the text prompt to send to Ollama.

#### `OllamaResponseData`
- **Purpose:** Represents a single chunk of data returned by Ollama.  
  Multiple chunks can be combined to obtain the complete response as a string.
- **Fields:**
  - `response` (**string**) — a single chunk of the response from Ollama.
  - `done` (**bool**) — indicates whether this chunk is the last; when `true`, all received chunks together form the complete response.

---

### Character Data

These structures manage character-related information and animation states.

#### `CharacterStatusData`
- **Purpose:** Holds available animations for a character and defines the default status to use if a received status is missing.
- **Fields:**
  - `availableCharacterStatuses` (**`List<string>`**) — a list of statuses representing available animations for the character.
  - `defaultCharacterStatus` (**string**) — the default status to use when a received status is not found in `availableCharacterStatuses`.

---

## Adding New Features

This section explains how to extend the project by adding new character animations and handling new URL endpoints.

---

### Adding a New Character Animation

To add a new animation for a character:

1. **Update the Animator Controller**
   - Open the **HumanoidBaseAnimationController** Animator.
   - Add the new animation clip.
   - Create transitions to and from existing animations, following the pattern of existing transitions.
   - Add a new **Trigger parameter** that corresponds to the new character status.

2. **Update `CharacterStatusData`**
   - Add the new status string to the **`availableCharacterStatuses`** list.
   - Optionally, adjust the **`defaultCharacterStatus`** if you want this new status to be the default in certain cases.

### Handling a New URL Endpoint

To handle a new server endpoint:

1. **Create a new ScriptableObject for the `NetworkHandler`**
   - Set the endpoint URL in the ScriptableObject.
   - For basic GET/POST requests, it should work without further modifications.
   - Ensure the event handlers (`OnResponseReceivedSuccess`, `OnResponseReceivedFailure`, etc.) are subscribed in your scripts to handle the responses.
